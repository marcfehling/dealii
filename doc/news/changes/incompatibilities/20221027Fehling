Changed: We introduced a stronger datatype for FE indices:
<ul>
  <li> Instead of unsigned int, we now use types::fe_index for FE indices throughout the library.
  <li> For invalid FE indices, we no longer use numbers::invalid_unsigned_int, but numbers::invalid_fe_index.
</ul>
This affects interfaces to a lot of functions. Most of them are backwards compatible via implicit conversion.
Functions that do not fall in that category are listed below and might need your attention.
Some of them have been deprecated, some are replaced because we imagine them only being used internally.
<ul>
  <li> DoFHandler::set_active_fe_indices() (deprecated)
  <li> DoFHandler::get_active_fe_indices() (deprecated)
  <li> hp::FECollection::hp_vertex_dof_identities()
  <li> hp::FECollection::hp_line_dof_identities()
  <li> hp::FECollection::hp_quad_dof_identities()
  <li> hp::FECollection::find_common_fes()
  <li> hp::FECollection::find_enclosing_fes()
  <li> hp::FECollection::find_dominating_fe()
  <li> hp::FECollection::find_dominated_fe()
  <li> hp::FECollection::find_dominating_fe_extended()
  <li> hp::FECollection::find_dominated_fe_extended()
  <li> hp::FECollection::get_hierarchy_sequence()
</ul>
Further, the serialization of parallel::distributed::Triangulation objects is also affected by this change
as we write FE indices to disk. Thus, the version in the serialization metafile has been bumped to `5`.
